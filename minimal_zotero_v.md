# minimal_zotero_v
[[minimal_zotero_v]] is a minimal github vault I designed to leverage the [https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) 

while integrating the workflow described by [[people/bryanjenks]] in [this blogpost](https://www.bryanjenks.dev/blog/obsidian-zotero-integration-plugin-streamline-your-research-paper-workflow-)

# Getting started
Before you get started you will need to get situated on a desktop system that you have enough privileges on that you can install arbitrary user programs. If you're a heavy obsidian mobile user don't despair! There is still a lot of functionality here for you, but you will need some sort of 'main' device that can handle the zotero interface.
##  Install the zotero desktop application

* *[download and install the zotero desktop application](https://www.zotero.org/download/)

Once you have installed the fat desk
## Install Better-BibTex add-on into Zotero
Once Zotero desktop application  has been installed, you will need to download [The *Zotero* 'Better- Bibtex' plugin](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases) (made by https://github.com/retorquere), and install it into the native desktop zotero application. 

> [!WARN] Warning
> During this stage you are adding a plugin to the native Zotero app! Not obsidian.
